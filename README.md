# Term-Deposit-Prediction
The GitHub project Term-Deposit-Prediction focuses on predicting whether bank customers will subscribe to term deposits based on marketing data. It uses the Bank Marketing dataset and applies machine learning techniques—primarily logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest—while addressing class imbalance and excluding features that could lead to data leakage (e.g., call duration). The workflow includes data cleaning, EDA, feature scaling, and model evaluation using metrics like Accuracy Score. The project aims to enhance marketing effectiveness by identifying likely subscribers for targeted campaigns.
